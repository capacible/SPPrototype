The ship never returned{comma} and was forgotten until the Arbiter found its remnants.'\nOther paragraphs are highighted as well.
,Another passage reads: 'King Harrold the Peaceful had ordered the crew of the Arbiter to set sail and conquer a certain island rumored to contain bountiful pallamide deposits.\nIn the years leading up to the Arbiter's voyage{comma} the esteemed kingdoms that had settled around Saltcrest were at war to take control of the only source of pallamide.'
,One highlighted passage talks about pallamide. It reads: 'The true nature of pallamide is uncertain. The Blaze of Saltcrest had left most{comma} if not all{comma} notable buildings of all the great kingdoms in ashes.
