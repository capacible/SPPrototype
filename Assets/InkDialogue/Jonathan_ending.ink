=== FINISH_GAME_JONATHAN ===
I blamed Jonathan for the missing plinth.
Despite the Director's hesitance, he fired him.
I never saw Jonathan again. Last I heard, he was taking odd jobs to make ends meet.
We never found the plinth, either.
I started to regret blaming Jonathan... but he seemed the most suspicious from all my investigations.
Either way, the exhibit went pretty well--or as well as it would have while missing one artifact.#active_ink:false
